    "This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and examples for running the Mixed Signal model, a numerical model for simulating different bioturbation processes and their effect on luminescence tracers. The code is written in the Julia programming language.\n",
    "\n",
    "The background, design and use cases of this model are described in the accompanying paper `Mixed signals: interpreting mixing patterns of different soil bioturbation processes through luminescence and numerical modelling`, by W.M. van der Meij, S. Riedesel and T Reimann (2024) [DOI]. This Jupyter Notebook will guide you through different uses of the model, which are the simulation of different bioturbation processes, process interactions, runs with varying parameters and the calibration of luminescence-based depth profiles. The required functions to run the model are stored in the file `Mixed-Signals_functions.jl`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simulated luminescence-based depth profiles are presented in three metrics:\n",
    "- The modal age of the age distributions, as the most probable age of each layer\n",
    "- The interquartile range, as a measure of the width of the distribution\n",
    "- the bioturbated fraction, as a measure of the fraction of bleached (i.e. bioturbated) particles in each layer. \n",

    "In the code below, the parameters are defined. The first block contains the parameters for defining the soil and luminescence tracers. The second block contains the parameters that determine process behaviour. The soil profile is represented by a matrix with a specified number of soil layers. With the parameters below, the soil is 2 meters deep and initially contains 100 soil layers of 2 cm thick. The uppermost layer of 5 mm is the layer where particles are bleached and their burial ages are set to zero. Every layer initially contains 150 luminescence particles. Each layer has a constant bulk density of 1500 kg $m^{-3}$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Through the transfer of soil mass by soil mixing during the simulations, the soil layer thicknesses and their number of luminescence particles will change. When layers get too thin or too thick (55% more or less that the initial thickness), they are either merged with neighbouring layers or split into two separate layers. These dynamic layer thicknesses enable an accurate simulation of additions and removals in different parts of the soil profile. When splitting and merging, the luminescence particles will also be divided or combined. The luminescence particles are stored in an array of arrays, which are able to store variable numbers of luminescence particles for each layer. "

    "### 7.2 Run the calibration scenarios\n",
    "Now it's time to run the calibration scenarios. The function `BT_calibration_run` contains all required initialisation, bioturbation and update functions. The results are a soil `s` and ages `a` array containing the results of that specific scenario. These are used to calculate the calibration error with the function `BT_calibration_errors`. The required inputs are the soil `s` and ages `a` arrays and the `calibration_data`. The `progress bar` will appear after the first calibration run is finished, which could take a __few minutes__.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function can calibrate on three metrics: the mode of the age distributions, the interquartile range of the age distributions and the bioturbated fraction. For each metric, the squared error is calculated. The calibration metrics can be included or excluded by switching the `true` to `false` in the calibration function in the code below. These  boolean operators for the different metrics are in the following order: mode, interquartile range, bioturbated fraction.\n",

    "The calibration function currently runs the calibration scenarios sequentially. Acceleration of calibration through parallellization is under construction for a next version of the model. "
