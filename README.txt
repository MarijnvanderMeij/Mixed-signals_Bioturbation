INTRODUCTION
This folder contains the model Mixed Signals, for simulating different bioturbation processes and their effects on luminescence tracers. The model contains the following files:
- a Jupyter Notebook which guides through the different functionalities of the model (Mixed-Signals.ipynb)
- a file containing all the required functions for simulations and visualizations (Mixed-Signals_functions.jl)
- a synthetic dataset of luminescence-depth information, that is used as illustration for the calibration of the model

GETTING STARTED
The model is written in the Julia language, which is a high-performance interactive scientific modelling language (https://julialang.org/). In order to run the model, Julia needs to be installed in the computer. 
Instructions for downloading Julia can be found here: https://julialang.org/downloads/. 

The model, in the form of a Jupyter Notebook (https://jupyter.org/) can be executed in your browser via Jupyter Notebook or in the integrated development environment Visual Studio Code.
Both programs require installation of software. Please visit the following sources for installation manuals:
- Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download
- Jupyter Notebook: https://jupyter.org/install

When installed, navigate to the folder where the download of the model is stored. From there, open Mixed-Signals.ipynb to start the model. 
Inside the Jupyter Notebook there are instructions for using the different functionalities of the model. For customization of the functions, the Mixed-Signals_functions.jl can be edited.
